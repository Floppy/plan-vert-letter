# Plan Vert
## An open letter to the Rails Core team and Ruby community

We think DHH is bad. We want our own Rails. That's ok - because DHH has graciously made the whole thing open source. So we can just do it. No permission needed. You gotta respect the guy for that at least.

So - we're really honestly, definitely going to hit that fork button on Github. We need a new name. How about "Off the Rails" ??

Less chat - more action. We're definitely going to do it. Really. Soon. We promise. That's the beauty of open source. We don't need any drama, we can just hit the fork button. It's right there on GitHub. We're definitely going to do it. Soon. Honest. We think we'll do a better job, and we can let reality be the judge. Look out for our new better "Off the Rails" ! Not vapourware - we can make this happen. We have the skills, the community, the backing. Honest.

### Notes (non-normative)

* We appreciate that this would be a very difficult process, and there are many reasons why it "can't be done". However, we don't really know unless we try, and at the very least we can show that there is community demand for action.

* We do not want to restrict DHH's freedom of speech, he can write and say what he likes. However, free speech is not "freedom from the consequences of that speech", and we as a community are completely free not to associate with people who hold views we find abhorrent.

* ["Plan Vert"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Railway_sabotage_during_World_War_II#France) was a railway sabotage campaign by the French resistance during WW2. Reference suggested by [@cinebox@masto.hackers.town](https://masto.hackers.town/@cinebox/115210459164892947).

* DHH's writings are available on [his blog](https://web.archive.org/web/20250920182553/world.hey.com/dhh); we link the archive.org mirror rather than send traffic his way.

* Many people have written their own thoughts on the problems with DHH's influence in Rails and the wider Ruby community (which is not a new problem, but is reaching new levels). Here's a selection:
  * [David Celis: Rails Needs New Governance](https://davidcel.is/articles/rails-needs-new-governance)
  * [Tekin Süleyman: The Ruby community has a DHH problem](https://tekin.co.uk/2025/09/the-ruby-community-has-a-dhh-problem)
  * [Jared White: Ruby Central is Not Behaving in Good Faith, and I’ve Got Receipts](https://jaredwhite.com/articles/ruby-central-is-not-operating-in-good-faith)
  * [Tom Stuart: The DHH Problem](https://tomstu.art/the-dhh-problem) (old, but illustrative)

* GitHub issues are disabled on this repo to keep it on-topic and reduce argumentative discussions that go nowhere. Feel free to discuss this in all the usual places though.
