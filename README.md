The days of socialist censorship and cancel-culture are coming to an end. If you don't like someone, nobody obliges you to deal with them.
Find another business, product or framework. It's that easy.
And while you're at it, it wouldn't hurt if you lowered your envy and resentment for other people's success.

Stop trying to forcibly change the world to your technocratic-socialist dystopia where everybody is forced to like everybody else and to take no step that may offend anybody.

Creativity requires freedom (to act and to speak). The opposite of play is tyranny. And it's the latter that this kind of messages lead to.
You want to play your leftist-socialist games? Find someone to play with and do it. Leave the rest of us alone.
