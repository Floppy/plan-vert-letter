# Plan Vert
## An open letter to Plan Vert

Stop being a pain in the ass and quit acting like a whiny little bitch. Go get a life or do something actually useful. If you don’t like the creator of something, don’t use it—make your own or go use something from someone you do like. Unless, of course, you’re just a complete incompetent who only knows how to tear down what others build while spewing ridiculous, hateful nonsense.
