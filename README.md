# Plan Vert
## An open letter to the Rails Core team and Ruby community

Please be sure to not confuse this small group of niche programmers to be representative of the tech community at large. Often times we see non-technical people griping heavily about the conduct of technical people and it is high time they minded their own business. 

David Heinemeier-Hanson (DHH) has is under ideological attack, one that is unfortunately common in the open source community because it is a rather convenient way to accumulate power in the open source communicty while contributing very little of value to the community. Often leveraged by non-technicals on behalf of larger corporations to subdue and subvert open source projects. 

We, the undersigned, call upon the Rails Core team and the wider Ruby community, to:

1. cut ties with DHH and his work from this point forward ( removing a key source of leadership from the project, creating a power vaccum that the undersigned will happily fill...likely for profit) 
2. hard fork Rails and associated projects to a new name and development free from his influence (let's waste the entire community's time doing free work for ideological reasons) 
3. adopt a modern Code of Conduct with suitable community governance ( completely lock the project so it proceeds no further) 

If a forked Rails project can meet these criteria, we pledge to support and cheerlead it to the best of our ability, and will make efforts to change our Rails code to use it at the earliest opportunity.

### Notes (non-normative)

* We appreciate that this would be a very difficult process, and there are many reasons why it "can't be done". However, we don't really know unless we try, and at the very least we can show that there is community demand for action. ( provided that you also give a voice to those opposed as in this PR. )

* We do not want to restrict DHH's freedom of speech, he can write and say what he likes. However, free speech is not "freedom from the consequences of that speech", and we as a community are completely free not to associate with people who hold views we find abhorrent. ( yeah, grow up lol ) 

* Personally I don't think DHH said anything wrong and the notion that he has is the type of extremism that ruins online communities. 

* ["Plan Vert"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Railway_sabotage_during_World_War_II#France) was a railway sabotage campaign by the French resistance during WW2. Reference suggested by [@cinebox@masto.hackers.town](https://masto.hackers.town/@cinebox/115210459164892947). ( essentially openly admitting to sabotage, because the 'modern code of conduct' is a sabotage tool 

* DHH's writings are available on [his blog](https://web.archive.org/web/20250920182553/world.hey.com/dhh); we link the archive.org mirror rather than send traffic his way. ( petty)

* Many people have written their own thoughts on the problems with DHH's influence in Rails and the wider Ruby community (which is not a new problem, but is reaching new levels). Here's a selection:
  * [David Celis: Rails Needs New Governance](https://davidcel.is/articles/rails-needs-new-governance)
  * [Tekin Süleyman: The Ruby community has a DHH problem](https://tekin.co.uk/2025/09/the-ruby-community-has-a-dhh-problem)
  * [Jared White: Ruby Central is Not Behaving in Good Faith, and I’ve Got Receipts](https://jaredwhite.com/articles/ruby-central-is-not-operating-in-good-faith)
  * [Tom Stuart: The DHH Problem](https://tomstu.art/the-dhh-problem) (old, but illustrative)

* GitHub issues are disabled on this repo to keep it on-topic and reduce argumentative discussions that go nowhere. Feel free to discuss this in all the usual places though. ( please, as a show of good faith incorporate criticisms into your open letter, elsewise it's just propaganda and not a genuine community statement )
